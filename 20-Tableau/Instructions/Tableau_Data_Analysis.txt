Through my analysis, I noticed that some of the most interesting trends included gender, with men showing a much greater increase in active ridership participation than women.
This could suggest that women are choosing to drive more than ride bikes as a means to commute. 
I also noticed that women have a longer trip duration than men, especially women born in the early 2000s. Considering that young 
women born around that time, most are either taking public transportation or getting driven by family members or friends to specified destinations.
In terms of total trips taken on Citibikes from year 2018, data shows that the majority of trips occur in May. This phenomenom could be influenced by 
the peaking warmer weather during the month of May heading into summer. 
Lastly, the most popular citybike start and end location for bikers is Grove Street Path in Manhattan which, with further analysis on the location,
can determine why that is a common meeting zone for bikers.
